# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Aiden and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I personally enjoy Blackjack.
    Understanding how a game works and being able to simply put the rules and systems
    into code was a very satisfying process that I hope to continue doing in my future
    life in computer science. I appreciate being able to use all of the tools we have
    been given to find the solution to the lab, it was like a game in itself just making
    the game, and I find that process very rewarding and entertaining.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite of mine because of the logical challenge it posed. This
    lab was not difficult at all in terms of what you had to code but instead shows us a
    different kind of problem you face in computer science, logic-based problems. The code
    was very simple, but you had to be able to accurately use several boolean operators
    in a long line of code in order to have the machine process the logic correctly. I
    appreciate having different types of problems in these labs because they help to expand
    the overall scope of my ability.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was my third favorite lab (in no particular order) because of how it
    relates to practical computer science work. I found it very interesting coding a program
    that, while not nearly being the same as what a pizza restaurant would use, very
    much resembles what it on a very simple and particular way. I enjoyed using files
    that were included in the assignment and found it very interesting that I was able to
    use my knowledge of matrices from math very clearly to understand what was going on.
